# Docker Images for ROS Development

This repository provides Docker images designed to simplify ROS 2 and ROS 1 development.  These images come pre-configured with the necessary ROS packages and tools, allowing you to get started with your robotics projects quickly and efficiently.

## Available Images

The following Docker images are available:

*   `humble`:  Based on `ubuntu:jammy`, this image includes ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill packages and a non-root user for enhanced security.
*   `humble-garden`:  Extends the `humble` image and includes Gazebo Garden, a powerful 3D robotics simulator.
*   `iron`: Based on `ubuntu:jammy`, this image includes ROS 2 Iron Irwini packages and a non-root user.
*   `iron-garden`: Extends the `iron` image and includes Gazebo Garden.
*   `noetic`: Based on `ubuntu:focal`, this image includes ROS Noetic Ninjemys packages and a non-root user.

**Important Note:** The `iron` and `iron-garden` images are currently **under development** and have not been heavily tested.  They may be unstable or contain significant bugs.

## Usage

### 1. Pulling an Image

To download a pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io), use the following command:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/soham2560/<image_name>:latest
```

Replace `<image_name>` with the desired image name (e.g., `humble`, `humble-garden`, `iron`, `iron-garden`). For example:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/soham2560/humble-garden:latest
```

### 2. Building an Image (Optional)

If you prefer to build the image locally from the Dockerfile, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.  Then, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/soham2560/<image_name> -f <image_name>/Dockerfile <image_name>
```

Again, replace `<image_name>` with the appropriate image name. For example, to build the `humble-garden` image:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/soham2560/humble-garden -f humble-garden/Dockerfile humble-garden
```

**Explanation of the `docker build` command:**

*   `docker build`: The command to build a Docker image.
*   `-t ghcr.io/soham2560/<image_name>`:  Tags the image with the specified name and registry path.
*   `-f <image_name>/Dockerfile`: Specifies the path to the Dockerfile to use for building the image.
*   `<image_name>`:  The build context, which is the directory containing the Dockerfile and any other files needed for the build.

### 3. Pushing an Image (For Contributors)

If you have made changes to the Dockerfile and want to contribute by pushing the updated image to the registry, use the following command:

```bash
docker push ghcr.io/soham2560/<image_name>:latest
```

**Note:**  You need to be authenticated with `ghcr.io` and have the appropriate permissions to push images to the `soham2560` repository.

## Usage Examples

The following repositories demonstrate how to use these Docker images in real-world ROS 2 projects with Dev Containers.  Each repository includes a `.devcontainer` folder for easy setup.

*   **[LiDAR_Camera_Calibration](https://github.com/soham2560/LiDAR_Camera_Calibration)**: Demonstrates LiDAR-Camera calibration in ROS 2 using the `humble` image within a Dev Container.

*   **[6DOF_ObjectFollowing](https://github.com/soham2560/6DOF_ObjectFollowing)**: Implements a 6-DOF object following system using ROS 2 and the `humble-garden` image within a Dev Container.

*   **[ros2_tutorial_repo](https://github.com/soham2560/ros2_tutorial_repo)**: A basic ROS 2 tutorial repository demonstrating fundamental concepts, configured with the `humble` image within a Dev Container.
*   **[Husky Mobile robot](https://github.com/RoboticsIIITH/husky_ws)**: Basic ROS Noetic packages for running the Husky mobile robot on AMD64/x86 device.
*   **[P3DX Mobile robot](https://github.com/rtarun1/P3DX-Docker)**: Basic ROS Noetic packages for running the P3DX mobile robot on AMD64/x86 device.
